# 4FSC0WD003 - Front-End Development

## Overview

Welcome to the JavaScript course! This course is designed to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of JavaScript programming language, covering fundamental concepts, advanced topics, and practical examples. By the end of this course, you will have the knowledge and skills to build dynamic and interactive web applications using JavaScript.

## Week 1 - Day 1

### JavaScript Basics

- **Comments**: Used to explain code and are not executed. There are two types: line comments and block comments.
- **Variables**: A variable is a piece of memory that stores a value that can be changed. Good naming practices are essential for maintainability. Reserved keywords (e.g., `let`, `var`, `const`) cannot be used as variable names.
- **Declaration Keywords**:
  - `var`: Function scoped, accessible anywhere in the function.
  - `let`: Block scoped, accessible only within the block.
  - `const`: Constant, can only be initialized once.

### Data Types

- **Definition**: Data types specify the kind of information a variable holds, guiding the computer on how to use it.
- **Primitive Data Types**: There are 7 primitive data types in JavaScript:
  - `string`
  - `number`
  - `BigInt`
  - `boolean`
  - `Symbol`
  - `undefined`
  - `null`
- **Non-Primitive Data Type**: The only non-primitive data type is `object`.
- **Immutability**: Primitive data types are immutable and stored on the Call Stack.
