# 4FSC0WD003 - Front-End Development

## Overview

Welcome to the JavaScript course! This course is designed to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of JavaScript programming language, covering fundamental concepts, advanced topics, and practical examples. By the end of this course, you will have the knowledge and skills to build dynamic and interactive web applications using JavaScript.

## Week 1 - Day 1

### JavaScript Basics

- **Comments**: Used to explain code and are not executed. There are two types: line comments and block comments.
- **Variables**: A variable is a piece of memory that stores a value that can be changed. Good naming practices are essential for maintainability. Reserved keywords (e.g., `let`, `var`, `const`) cannot be used as variable names.
- **Declaration Keywords**:
  - `var`: Function scoped, accessible anywhere in the function.
  - `let`: Block scoped, accessible only within the block.
  - `const`: Constant, can only be initialized once.

### Data Types

- **Definition**: Data types specify the kind of information a variable holds, guiding the computer on how to use it.
- **Primitive Data Types**: There are 7 primitive data types in JavaScript:
  - `string`
  - `number`
  - `BigInt`
  - `boolean`
  - `Symbol`
  - `undefined`
  - `null`
- **Non-Primitive Data Type**: The only non-primitive data type is `object`.
- **Immutability**: Primitive data types are immutable and stored on the Call Stack.

### Conditional Statements

- **if/else statements**: Execute code blocks based on conditions
- **switch statements**: Alternative syntax for multiple conditions (syntactic sugar)
- **Ternary operator**: Concise one-line conditional expressions `condition ? true_value : false_value`

### Loops

- **for loop**: Iterate with counter variable, ideal for arrays with index access
- **forEach**: Array method for iterating over each element
- **while loop**: Execute code while a condition remains true

### Objects

- **Object literals**: Key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces `{}`
- **Properties**: Can contain any data type including nested objects and arrays
- **Methods**: Functions defined as object properties
- **Dot notation**: Access object properties using `object.property`

## Week 1 - Day 2

### Review Quiz

A comprehensive quiz covering Day 1 topics is available in `01_basics/00_exercises/quiz_day1_review.js`. Topics include:
- Variables and declarations (var, let, const)
- Data types and typeof operator
- String concatenation vs template literals
- Arithmetic operations
- Arrays and indexing
- Logical operators (&&, ||, !)
- Comparison operators (==, ===)

## How to Use This Repository

- Each topic is organized into separate folders containing example code.
- Experiment with the example code to reinforce your understanding and practice JavaScript programming.
